i would give up heaven if had to 
just to get another taste of your
sweet hee hee venom nom nom 
yah all i need hee hee 
is your poison

i, i just woke up from a dream,
were you i and i had to say goodbye,
i don't know what it all mean ,
since i survied ,  i realised ,
wherever you go that's where i follow,
nobody's promised tomorrow,
so im'ma love like every night like it's a last night,
like it's a last night,
if the world was ending , i wanna be next to you,
if the party over , and our time on earth is tooo,
i wanna hold you,
just for a while ,
and die with a smile
if the world was ending,
i wanna be next to you
