thinking about me , every night ohh ,
isn't that sweet i guess so,
say you can't sleep, baby i know,
that's that me espresso,
i can't relate to desperation, 
my give a lucks are on vacation,
when caught this one boy,
and he won't stop calling,
when i act this way i know i got them,
too bad your ex won't do it for you,
walked in dream came true for you , 
soft skin and i perfumed for you'
i know i mountain dew it for you,
that morning coffee brew it for you,
one touch and i brand new it for you,
now he's thinking about me ,every night ohh ,
isn't that sweet i guess so,
say you can't sleep, baby i know,
that's that me espresso,
move up down left right oohh,
isn't sweet i guess so
